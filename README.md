App that reads input and turns off and on relay that can be attached to home appliance. In onoff12.ino it is directly controlled by serial monitor once you attach arduino(any). In the onoff12wifi it is set to read console input on Arduino Yun.  Uploaded the java program. In order to use this project you need Arduino Yun board.
